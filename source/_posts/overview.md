### The Good News
I have discovered an abundant, ancient, but **overlooked** natural resource that can reduce water consumption worldwide.  It can be used daily by millions of people for personal comfort and cleanliness.  It also can be used in construction, agriculture and sanitation. It has an infinite shelf life.

This commodity is easily and quickly produced wherever bamboo grows.  Plantations and remote villages can add this revenue stream with little capital investment.

Minimal processing is required to make finished products, merely sifting, mixing or sewing.

It is currently in the environment and has been well tolerated by humans for millions of years.

### The Bad News
It's bug poop.  From *Dinoderus Minutis* -- the dreaded Bamboo Borer beetle.

### The Job:
Create a worldwide market place for Bamboo Snow and raise the well-being of millions.

## Unicorn's Lament
I have never created a worldwide industry in an unknown commodity from a tiny tropic island in the vastness of the Deep Pacific Ocean, so if you can do it better, go ahead!

My plan is to simply publish my observations and encourage a legion of entrepreneurs to get involved with Bamboo Snow.
