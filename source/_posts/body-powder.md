This is on my Must Have list for daily use.
<!-- excerpt -->

Simply mix a few drops of Essential Oils into bamboo snow.  I use an off-the-shelf oil branded "White Flower," but Eucalyptus or Tea Tree oils work great too.

Bamboo Snow mixes quickly and easily with nearly anything in any amount and is perfect for specialty powders for personal use.

Create unique and brandable products from your own recipies.
