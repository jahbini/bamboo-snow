# Climate Busting Vest
A vest made with a one quarter to one half inch of bamboo snow filling absorbs sweat far better than cotton.

Bamboo Snow is an excellent thermal insulator, and keeps you warm in the cold, and cool in the heat.

Bamboo Snow also breathes --- it will absorb the sweat from your body and keep you and your clothes dry when the humidity rises.

The vest was tested by several island residents, including two athletes who used it during training: all confirmed the utility of the vest.
