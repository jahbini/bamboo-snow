<p>##Analysis of Saipan Market Potential for Products from Bamboo Snow</p>
<p>###Local Buying Segments and Market Structure</p>
<p>Saipan is a depressed area with limited resources.  Tourism is a major industry.  Fishing and agriculture fill only local markets – shipping off island is not feasable for perishible goods.  Shipping is very expensive, both to and from Saipan.  A local fish processing plant sits idle.</p>
<p>Saipan has about 40,000 people, and Tinnian and Rota maybe 7,000 more each.  There is NO mail delivery in the CNMI.  No home addresses, no mailbox.  You can’t mail a letter to the guy across the street.  No p-mail addresses in the whole island chain.  The newspapers are NOT delivered, but are available in stores, and seldom sell out.</p>
<p>Common lines of communication like newspaper ads or US Mail are out. Many people use English as amatuers.</p>
<p>Demographics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>native</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Chamorro – The Chamorros were forcibly removed from Saipan by the Spanish conquistdores to Guam.  They did not have the fast sea-going canoes of the Carolinians, and were more easily subjugated.</p>
<p>I’m told the Spanish used Saipan for range for the cattle, sheep or goats or whatever.<br>Camorros started coming back about the time of the Spanish-American war.  They are the largest native segment.  Mostly they have strong blood ties to the phillipines.  The Chamorros have lost 95% or more of their culture, no songs, dances, stories, only the language.  They did not even adapt the Spanish culture as the Philipinos had.  Just Roman Catholicism.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Carolinian – The Carolinians were true sea-going gypsies.  Their territorry was great expanses of open ocean with a few tiny islands. The islands would get smashed by disasters often: typhoons and overfishing.  Small island, small resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their boats were faster than the Spanish, and so they were able to retain songs, dances, legends much better.  They came to Saipan in the late 1800’s because of bad weather back on the home islands.  The Spanish were tired of their Empire by then and could not mount enough force to clear Saipan again.</p>
<p>Both Carolinian and Chamorro are represented by about 40 strong families: The family relationships are complicated – you can be a cousin for one family tree and an uncle by another set of relationships.  Neither group likes to work or have much real entrepreneurial spirit.  The Carolinians like to fish.  The Chomorros like to farm.  Otherwise they go into Government or teaching.  Maybe nursing.</p>
<p>A strong amount of culture-clash comes from allegiance to family as opposed to allegiance to capitalism, The Law, The Constitution, or whatever.  They have strong commitment to calling, recieving or sending money to relatives on other islands or the mainland or wherever.</p>
<p>A Chamo-linian family will spend lavisly on First Year Birthdays, Weddings and Funerals.  (Sadly, there are no huki-laus, although one village on the south shore of Guam still does.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Russian locals:</em> These are mostly shopkeepers, restraunteurs or cater to specific tourist segments.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Filipinos:</em> About 15% to 25% are close Filipino relatives of the Chamorros.  Many of these came to Saipan as “guest workers” and chose to stay after the guest worker visa program was shut down by the Federal Government.  Highly religious.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Pacific Islanders:</em> from lots of places – usually have a few cousins on the island, but don’t really call Saipan home:</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Bangladesh:</em>  Why there are Bengalis on the island beats me.  They are mostly beach-boys at the Hotels.  Total family population is about 100 to 200 people.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Haole:</em> a few professional and Federal positions are staffed by mainlanders.  Saipan may not attract the best and the brightest.  Military presence is limited.  However, there are always five or six large freighters anchored outside the reef: all filled with Uncle Sam’s war toys, ready to deploy to “hot spots.”  Crews and technicians shuffle on and off the island constantly.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Tourists:</em>  These are from the western Pacific Rim – Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Russian.  All of these tourists could and would buy locally made products, except there are few: One or two small craft stores as well as an herbal called “noni.”  Swap meets here have few local craft items on display.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Marketplace_analysis"><a href="#Marketplace_analysis" class="headerlink" title="Marketplace analysis"></a>Marketplace analysis</h2><p>Lack of effective communications to local residents is a big deal:  A poster at the laundromat would reach the largest group.  Language difficulties present the biggest hurdle with this approach.  Newspapers “could” get to local investors, if the product was right.  The tourist marketplace is most easily targeted by the one or two craft shops in the hotel district.  If a product started selling to this market, the volume could be large.</p>
<p>Saipan is poor.  The closest thing you might compare it to is Appalachia or Dogpatch with smartphones and new cars.  Local crafts are not prevalent:  Crafting is often regarded as merely something to keep prison inmates busy.</p>
<h1 id="Possible_Products"><a href="#Possible_Products" class="headerlink" title="Possible Products"></a>Possible Products</h1><ul>
<li><p><em>Craft Powder:</em>  Clean, sifted bamboo snow can be packaged as an aid to crafting or repair.  It makes a great filler for any kind of glue:  With sufficient bamboo snow, the mass turns into a putty that is easily shaped and molded by hand.  When dry, the bamboo snow on the surface of the putty can be painted.  In addition, the surface will have enough “tooth” so that it can be glued later.</p>
<p>This form could be sold even locally at “Ace Hardware.”</p>
<p>The craft powder requires the least processing to achieve a viable product.  The major expenses would be packageing, marketing and shipping.  A oatmeal sized container could return $10 to $15 dollars at the retail (mainland) level.  A small package of an ounce would be enough for several small repairs and might fetch three dollars. </p>
